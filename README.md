## This project was done using ReactJS and NodeJS, both on front and back-end.

Made based on Firebase Database and Storage, you need two things to get this running through your client: 

## Front-end
Type: "yarn start", and it will automatically run the npm install to all dependencies you need to get start and run your front-end server

## Back-end
Type: "npm run dev" to get all things done. There's a lot of packages you need to install at the back-end, so run this script and it will install all for you at your local machine

# How to know you got started?

Front: runs at localhost:3000, so be sure you get at this port
Back: your server runs at port 5000, but uses the "/Products" to get access to all database information, if you try postman or insomnia to CRUD this API, remember of all endpoint.
